Blood Crusader is a leukemia fighting game. You are a nanobot on a mission: eliminate the cancer cells you find in the bloodstream!

Blood Crusader is one of the first games I wrote. The UI is not very friendly and the code is probably not that great. Therefore, I'm remaking it with a better game design, and using OOP!
